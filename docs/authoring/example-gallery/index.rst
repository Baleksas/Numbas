Gallery of example questions
============================

Each of the examples in this gallery showcases a different feature of Numbas.
They assume that you've already worked through the :ref:`write-your-first-question` tutorial.

There's a description of the :ref:`planning <planning-a-question>` decisions made when designing each question, and step-by-step instructions to implement it.

.. note::

    These examples are still being written.
    More examples will appear soon.
