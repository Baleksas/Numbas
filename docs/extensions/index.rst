Extensions
==========

An extension is a collection of or more files that should be included in an exam, providing new functionality to Numbas or customising it in some way.

Extensions are enabled on a per-question basis.
When an exam is compiled, all extensions required by any question in the exam are enabled.

You can create an extension from scratch within the editor, or upload an extension package from your computer.
